Using branch
============

Reference : http://www.zorched.net/2008/04/14/start-a-new-branch-on-your-remote-git-repository/

Creating a remote branch
------------------------

1. Create the remote branch

git push origin origin:refs/heads/new_feature_name

2. Make sure everything is up-to-date

git fetch origin

3. Then you can see that the branch is created.

git branch -r
This should show ‘origin/new_feature_name’

4. Start tracking the new branch

git checkout --track -b new_feature_name origin/new_feature_name
This means that when you do pulls that it will get the latest from that branch as well.

5. Make sure everything is up-to-date

git pull

Checking on which branch the current environment is
---------------------------------------------------

git branch

Switching to another branch
---------------------------

1/ if some file have not been commited, you may need to stash them :

git stash

2/ switch to the other environment :

git checkout master

3/ make sure you have the latest changes :

git pull

4/ do your evil deeds and commit...

5/ switch back to your environment

git checkout new_feature_name

6/ restore your steshed changes

git stash pop

Pushing and pulling
-------------------

Push and pull update both branch separately.

Updating the working branch with the latest dev on master
---------------------------------------------------------

1/ while being on the new_feature_name branch, do :

git pull origin master

2/ solve the conflicts and commit :)


Merging back the working branch into the master
-----------------------------------------------



Deleting completely a remote branch
-----------------------------------

git push origin :heads/new_feature_name


Adding a tag when deploying into production
-------------------------------------------

When master is deployed on production, a tag with the date need to be placed on the master branch.
The tag is named prod_YYYYMMDD 
If multiple deploys are done on the same day, the following tags are named prod_YYYYMMDD.X X being an integer (starting at 0)

1/ make sure you are on master branch

git checkout master

2/ add the tag

git tag -a prod_YYYYMMDD -m 'deploy'

3/ push the tags to the repository

git push --tags
