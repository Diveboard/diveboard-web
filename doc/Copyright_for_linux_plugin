Hi,

For your information, I've just compiled the plugin on Mac and windows and
it looks to work correctly on both platforms.

Also, there is a topic we probably should have discussed before, but better
late than never, about copyrights :)
As you've probably seen, we're not currently releasing the source code of
the plugin under GPL. That may come some day, depending also on the feedback
we'll get from users, but we'd rather keep it closed-sourced for the moment.


So, I'm suggesting that to thank you for your work and in exchange of your
clearance to use the code you did, we add your name with our thanks on the
"About" page (https://www.diveboard.com/about). Would you be OK for that kind
of arrangement ?

By the way, what's your occupation ? Might you be somehow interested in
getting someday more involved on Diveboard ? ;)

Thanks,
Pascal

Hi Pascal, great to hear I didn't break anything else!

I did notice that there was no licence, while I am a big supporter of 
open source I also more than understand from a development point of view 
about keeping it closed source, especially while the site is still 
getting off the ground.

While the code remains closed source it is always assuring to see that 
there is a bulk data export option on the site so that the raw data 
remains available to users.  It would however be nice if this had other 
export formats such as UCDF which you are already using on the server.

I'm more than happy if you wish to include me on the about page. 
Currently I'm working as a self employed web designer and IT consultant:
http://www.davidrosswebdesign.com/

I have only recently taken up diving but I am hoping that it will become 
a more regular hobby, if there are any specific areas I can help then 
let me know and I'll see how much available time I have to offer.

David
